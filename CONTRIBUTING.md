## 🙋‍♀️ Opening an Issue

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest a feature, you are welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/cairoeth/rustmate/issues/new). Before opening an issue, please review the existing open and closed issues.

When you propose a new feature, you should provide as much detail as possible, especially on the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritised by their potential impact on the ecosystem, so we value information that shows the impact could be high.
